Source code for a React app which acts as a digital ID card of Vastav

## Pre-requisites
1. React.js installed(run **npm install react** for this one)
2. Wouter installed(run **npm install wouter** for this one)(used for routing)
3. A text-editor like VS Code(available at [this link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))

### To run the app in your PC, follow ahead
1. Open the **digicard** folder that you will extract
2. Open it with VS Code
3. Go to the App.js page
4. Open Terminal
5. Run the command, **npm start**
6. If all pre-requisites are fulfilled, you should see the message that says **webpack compiled successfully** at the end
7. Also, unless you install Nodejs and add it to PATH, npm won't work

Kindly run **npm install** in the React source code directory, this installs the _node_modules_ directory which contains important packages and dependencies for running the React app in a local environment
